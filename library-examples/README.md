# Library Examples

This folder contains **symbolic links** to example sketches from installed Arduino libraries.

## How it works

When you install a library through the Arduino Library Manager, its examples
automatically appear here as links. You can:

1. **Browse examples** - Open and read example code directly in VS Code
2. **Compile & Upload** - Examples work directly from this location
3. **Copy to modify** - Copy an example to your own folder to customize it

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- This folder is **auto-generated** - don't add your own files here
- Links point to `/home/vscode/Arduino/libraries/`
- If you edit an example here, you're editing the original library file
- **To customize an example**: Copy it to your project folder first!

## What you'll see here

After installing libraries, you'll see folders like:

```
library-examples/
├── Servo/
│   ├── Knob/
│   │   └── Knob.ino
│   └── Sweep/
│       └── Sweep.ino
├── Adafruit_NeoPixel/
│   └── ...
└── Grove_Ultrasonic_Ranger/
    └── ...
```

## Refreshing Examples

Examples sync automatically when you:

- Install a library
- Upgrade a library
- Uninstall a library

To manually refresh: Open Arduino Manager → Library Manager → click "Sync Examples"

## Copying an Example to Your Project

1. Find the example you want in this folder
2. Right-click the example folder (e.g., `Sweep/`)
3. Select "Copy"
4. Navigate to your project folder in the workspace root
5. Right-click and "Paste"
6. Rename if desired and start customizing!
